# Adaptive control assignments
This repository contains the solutions of assignments from adaptive control course.

Topics covered in assignments:
1. System identification with least squares estimation(LSE) method
2. System identification with least mean squares(LMS), recursive least 
    squares(RLS) and gradient descent
3. Model reference adaptive control(MRAC) and full state feedback adaptive control
4. Output based MRAC and adaptive control of a robot
5. Reinforcement learning: k-armed bandit, value iterations, policy iterations
